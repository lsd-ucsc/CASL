# CASL reading group

If you show up to reading group, be ready to participate in the discussion!

To structure our discussions, here are four questions I suggest we ask ourselves for each paper we read.  Note that, while all of them require reading some of the paper, none of them require reading all of the paper. (Lindsey got the idea to use this list of questions from Chung-chieh Shan.)

1. What's the paper about?
2. What's one thing I learned?
3. What's one question I'm curious about?
4. What's one step I can take towards answering the question?

Some papers to consider might be available on the [CASL group resources](resources.md) list, but others are welcome too!

# Fall 2022

## Schedule of readings

This list is tentative and subject to change.

Everyone should claim two weeks and list the papers they want to discuss those weeks.  Try to pick papers that are relevant to the research problems you personally are interested in, but also that you hope will be relevant and approachable to the group at large!
