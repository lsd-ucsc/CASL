# Distributed Software Systems: Global-First and Local-First Perspectives

## Part I: Global First!

[Multitier programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_programming) and [choreographic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choreographic_programming) are distributed programming paradigms in which a single program expresses the behavior of multiple participants.  Multitier programming has existed in some form or another since the early 2000s (and its roots go back further than that), but much of the work in this space, such as [Pirouette](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3498684), is still quite new and experimental.  We call this approach "global-first" because in multitier and choreographic programming, one begins by considering the behavior of an entire system.  While various approaches to distributed programming purport to ["let you think about your application as a single program that happens to run on multiple machines, rather than a collection of programs running on different machines that talk to one another"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/parallel-and-concurrent/9781449335939/ch14.html), and hence simplify matters, global-first programming takes this point of view to the extreme: in global-first programming, you have *no choice* but to think of your application as a single program.

In this part of the course, we will study the multitier and choreographic programming research literature and consider the strengths and weaknesses of a global-first approach.  For example, a strength of choreographic programming is ["deadlock-freedom-by-design"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2480359.2429101): because communication between participants can only be expressed by a single language construct (which compiles to a message *send* on one participant and a *receive* on another), it is impossible for the resulting collection of programs to contain a mismatched send and receive.  On the other hand, a potential shortcoming of this approach is an assumption that communication must be instantaneous, synchronous, and lossless.  Can the promise of deadlock-freedom-by-design actually be realized on an asynchronous Internet where ["everything fails all the time"](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/2/242334-everything-fails-all-the-time/fulltext)?  Furthermore, does the global-first programming approach make sense for applications where we may not know in advance how all participants in an execution will behave or how they should interact?

## Part II: Local First!

In seeming contrast to multitier and choreographic programming is the notion of ["local-first"](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) software, in which network connections are expected to be intermittent, different participants may be running different versions of an application, and individuals operate autonomously with a minimum of centralization and coordination.

[Conflict-free replicated data types](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2050613.2050642) -- data structures designed for replication across multiple participants in a setting where coordination may be infrequent -- have been [proposed](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) as a foundational technology for local-first software, and have seen much attention in the programming languages and verification research world in the last ten years.  [Content-addressable storage](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/383059.383072) will also be a topic of discussion: it is particularly well suited to decentralized systems, in which the contents of the data to be retrieved are more important than its current physical location.

(Something about how we want to approach local-first like scientists, and resist dogma, techno-utopianism, and longtermism)

Patrick's take:
 - (corresponds to 1 and 3 in the LFS article) Literally "local first" means that the software should work when there's no network connection.
This means that after reconnecting, there's some way to resolve my edits against the edits made by other users while I was offline.
 - (corresponds to 2 and 4 in the LFS article) A knock on of this is that there's a way to find out if the people I'm using the software with (view?) are online, or, alternatively, there's a way to store information in the network. Network storage or peer-to-peer connectivity are necessary.
 - (corresponds to 2 in the LFS article) Network storage is better because it enables asynchronous collaboration.  Host-oriented networks are inherently anti "local first" and anti peer-to-peer, so content addressing is desirable.
