# Distributed Software Systems: Global-First and Local-First Perspectives

## Part I: Global First!

TODO: list of papers on multitier and choreographic programming (Links, Hop.js, ScalaLoci, Montesi's work, Pirouette, ...)

## Part II: Local First!

What does "local first" mean in terms of technical requirements, especially from a language/systems perspective?

Patrick's take:
 - (corresponds to 1 and 3 in the LFS article) Literally "local first" means that the software should work when there's no network connection.
This means that after reconnecting, there's some way to resolve my edits against the edits made by other users while I was offline.
 - (corresponds to 2 and 4 in the LFS article) A knock on of this is that there's a way to find out if the people I'm using the software with (view?) are online, or, alternatively, there's a way to store information in the network. Network storage or peer-to-peer connectivity are necessary.
 - (corresponds to 2 in the LFS article) Network storage is better because it enables asynchronous collaboration.  Host-oriented networks are inherently anti "local first" and anti peer-to-peer, so content addressing is desirable.

Applications" (SIGCOMM '01) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/964723.383071 (early, highly-cited paper on DHTs)

 - "Using Lightweight Modeling to Understand Chord" https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2185376.2185383 (using Alloy to find bugs in Chord)

### CRDTs

 - "Conflict-free replicated data types" (SSS '11) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2050613.2050642 (the original CRDT paper)
 
 - Could be a lot more CRDT papers in here...

 - "Certified mergeable replicated data types" (PLDI '22)  https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3519939.3523735 (A recent good paper about CRDTs; but there are many options)
 
### Content-addressability and network storage

 - "A scalable content-addressable network" https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/383059.383072 (The paper that introduced the term "content-addressable")
 
 - "IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System" https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3561 (Maybe, if we can't find something better about IPFS)
 
 - "The Dat Project, an open and decentralized research data tool" (Scientific Data, 2018) https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018221
 
 - "Dat - Distributed Dataset Synchronization And Versioning" (2017) - https://osf.io/nsv2c/ (maybe make optional?)
