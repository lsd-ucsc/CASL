# Distributed Software Systems: Global-First and Local-First Perspectives

## Part I: Global First!

TODO: list of papers on multitier and choreographic programming (Links, Hop.js, ScalaLoci, Montesi's work, Pirouette, ...)

## Part II: Local First!

What does "local first" mean in terms of technical requirements, especially from a language/systems perspective?

Patrick's take:
 - (corresponds to 1 and 3 in the LFS article) Literally "local first" means that the software should work when there's no network connection.
This means that after reconnecting, there's some way to resolve my edits against the edits made by other users while I was offline.
 - (corresponds to 2 and 4 in the LFS article) A knock on of this is that there's a way to find out if the people I'm using the software with (view?) are online, or, alternatively, there's a way to store information in the network. Network storage or peer-to-peer connectivity are necessary.
 - (corresponds to 2 in the LFS article) Network storage is better because it enables asynchronous collaboration.  Host-oriented networks are inherently anti "local first" and anti peer-to-peer, so content addressing is desirable.

### Overview/motivation

 - "Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet
Applications" (SIGCOMM '01) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/964723.383071 (early, highly-cited paper on DHTs)

 - "Using Lightweight Modeling to Understand Chord" https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2185376.2185383 (using Alloy to find bugs in Chord)
 
 - "Kademlia: A Peer-to-Peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric" https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/646334.687801 (follow-up to Chord)
 
 - "Pastry: Scalable, Decentralized Object Location, and Routing for Large-Scale Peer-to-Peer Systems" (Middleware 2001) https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45518-3_18 (early, highly-cited paper on DHTs)
 
 - "Scribe: a large-scale and decentralized application-level multicast infrastructure" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1038579 (highly-cited multicast system built on top of Pastry)
 
### CRDTs

 - "Conflict-free replicated data types" (SSS '11) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2050613.2050642 (the original CRDT paper)
 
 - Could be a lot more CRDT papers in here...

 - "Certified mergeable replicated data types" (PLDI '22)  https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3519939.3523735 (A recent good paper about CRDTs; but there are many options)
 
### Content-addressability and network storage

The authors of the local-first software essay don't talk about content-addressability or DHTs specifically.  However, we think it should be a topic of discussion: content-addressable storage is particularly well suited to decentralized systems, in which the contents of the data to be retrieved are more important than its current physical location.

 - "A scalable content-addressable network" https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/383059.383072 (The paper that introduced the term "content-addressable")

 - "IPFS and Friends: A Qualitative Comparison of Next Generation Peer-to-Peer Data Networks" (IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 2022) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9684521 (looks like a high-quality survey paper covering IPFS, Swarm, Hypercore (Dat), SAFE, Storj, and Arweave, and contextualizing them with respect to previous work)

### Digital preservation

 - "The LOCKSS peer-to-peer digital preservation system" (ToCS 2005) https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1047915.1047917 ("Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe"; relates to the digital-preservation aspect of the local-first movement)
 
 - "The Dat Project, an open and decentralized research data tool" (Scientific Data, 2018) https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018221
 
### Some primary sources that might be worth a look

 - "IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System" https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3561 (Maybe, if we can't find something better about IPFS)

 - "Dat - Distributed Dataset Synchronization And Versioning" (2017) - https://osf.io/nsv2c/ (maybe make optional?)
